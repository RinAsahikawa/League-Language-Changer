# League-Language-Changer

First "script" I "wrote" to swap languages in League with Python

This is a raw file.

Very primitive technology but it works. 

Does not find your league of legend path, assumes its at C:/Riot Games. Only works when client is not opened. 

Close client before using. 

Code is done very badly, its copy and pasted from multiple sources, stiched together with my short experience. 

Hope it works for you!~
