# League-Language-Changer

First small app I made to swap languages in League with Python

There is Raw and Folder

Download folder as ZIP and run main.exe.

Very primitive technology but it works. 

Does not find your league of legend path, assumes its at C:/Riot Games. Only works when client is not opened. 

Close client before using. 

Code is done very badly, its copy and pasted from multiple sources, stiched together with my 2 days of experience. 

Hope it works for you!~
